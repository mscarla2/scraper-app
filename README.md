# Scraper App

## Developer

Created by [Marco Scarlata](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-scarlata)


## Inspiration

As you go on through your job search, you sporatically run into good companies that have some things that make you really excited to be applying. Then, you run into the fact that they don't
sponsor international students -- oftentimes later into the process than you would've liked. 


## What it does

This scraper app is something that I've built that mitigates this process by providing curated details on the top sponsoring companies, so that you can both make the application process easier for yourself
as well as find a company that you resonate with that also provides statisically more sponsorships than a lot of other companies in the U.S

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. CD into the file
3. Run `streamlit run my_app.py`   

(*Note*: If you're encountering a path issue with chromedriver, please make sure its in the same folder as the my_app.py file)

Within the StreamLit UI, you can then select the "TOP OPT Listings" to generate a list of the top 100 companies that sponsor H1B visas for OPT students.
